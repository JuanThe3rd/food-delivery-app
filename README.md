# Food Delivery App

## Project Description
"Food Delivery" app that hosts multiple restaurants. You will be able to login where your account will show your name, profile picture, previous orders, and reviews from restaurants you've ordered from. You will be able to choose amongst a list of restaurants and add food to cart. Once you're ready to checkout, your order will be added to your 'past orders' section in your account. You will also have the ability to login as a restaurant in order to add, update, or delete a menu item. Each restaurant will have reviews left by customers. Stretch goals include adding a friends section where you can add other people's accounts to your friends list. You and your friend will be able to see each other's accounts, as well as communicate through text messages.
