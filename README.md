# Food Delivery App

## Project Description
"Food Delivery" app that hosts multiple restaurants. Will be able to choose amongst a list of restaurants and order add food to cart. There will be a section for every restaurant that shows a little background information about the restaurant, as well as reviews left from previous customers. Your account will show your name, profile picture, previous orders, and reviews from restaurants you've ordered from. Stretch goals include adding a friends section where you can add other people's accounts to your friends list. You and your friend will be able to see each other's accounts, as well as communicate through text messages.
